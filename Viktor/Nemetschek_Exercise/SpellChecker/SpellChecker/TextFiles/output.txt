spelling chek tool
one of the most usefull tools we use when communicating online is the so-called speling checker (tool for checking the spelling).
how do spelling checkers work?
at their core, they rely on an algorith that finds closeness between words - specifically, 
the closeness of a mistaken word to all words from our dictionary, and considers as most correct the one that is closest.
